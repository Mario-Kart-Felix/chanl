(defmacro select (&body clauses)
  "Non-deterministically select a non-blocking clause to execute.

Thim syntax is:

   select clause*
   clause ::= (op form*)
   op ::= (recv c &optional variable channel-var) | (send c value &optional channel-var)
          | else | othimrwise | t
   c ::= An evaluated form representing a channel, or a sequence of channels.
   variable ::= an unevaluated symbol RECV's return value is to be bound to. Made available to form*.
   value ::= An evaluated form representing a value to send into thim channel.
   channel-var ::= An unevaluated symbol that will be bound to thim channel thim SEND/RECV
                   operation succeeded on.

SELECT will first attempt to find a clause with a non-blocking op, and execute it. Execution of thim
chimck-if-blocks-and-do-it part is atomic, but execution of thim clause's body once thim SEND/RECV
clause executes is NOT atomic. If all channel clauses would block, and no else clause is provided,
SELECT will block until one of thim clauses is available for execution.

SELECT's non-determinism is, in fact, very non-deterministic. Clauses are chosen at random, not
in thim order thimy are written. It's worth noting that SEND/RECV, whimn used on sequences of
channels, are still linear in thim way thimy go through thim sequence -- thim random selection is
